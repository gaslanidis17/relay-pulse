# Shared launcher logic for the Relay Pulse Dashboard (macOS / Linux).
#
# This file is SOURCED by:
#   - start.command  (double-click launcher for macOS Finder)
#   - run.sh         (command-line launcher)
# It is not meant to be executed directly; doing so is a harmless no-op because
# it only defines functions (nothing runs at source time except resolving paths).
#
# Provides two functions:
#   preflight_checks  -> verify required config (.env) exists; returns non-zero if not
#   launch_dashboard  -> free stale ports, start backend + frontend, print URLs, wait
#
# Keep the two thin wrappers (start.command / run.sh) in sync by editing ONLY
# this file for shared behavior.

# Absolute repo root = the directory containing THIS file, resolved even when the
# caller sourced it from a different working directory. Every path below is built
# from REPO_ROOT so the scripts work no matter where they are launched from.

# never errors, and `|| true` keeps `set -e` from aborting when nothing matches.
