"""SSO-safe, non-blocking background auto-refresh for stale dashboard caches.

The dashboard's Snowflake connection authenticates via Okta ``externalbrowser``
SSO — opening a connection pops an interactive browser login. We therefore must
NEVER trigger a live query automatically (on tab open / poll) unless a connection
is already established. This module is the gate + bookkeeping for that:

  * ``trigger(scope, warm_fn)`` starts ``warm_fn`` on a daemon thread **only when
    a Snowflake connection is already live** (``snowflake_client.connection_is_live``).
    If no connection is live it does nothing and reports ``reason="sso_required"``
    so the caller can serve cached-but-stale data and the UI can surface a
    "needs refresh" affordance instead of spawning an SSO popup.
  * Jobs are de-duplicated per ``scope`` (one in-flight warm per scope) and have a
    cooldown after finishing so a fast client re-poll loop — or a scope that is
    genuinely behind (e.g. Snowflake hasn't loaded yesterday yet) — cannot hammer
    the warehouse.
  * On completion the job evicts the matching in-memory cache prefixes so the next
    request re-assembles from the freshly written disk cache.

The actual warm work (which SQL to re-run, how) lives in the routers as closures;
this module only owns the SSO gate, threading, status, and cache eviction.
