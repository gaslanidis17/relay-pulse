"""Serve-stale + SSO-gated background warm for the city-detail tabs.

The city tabs (Late / Rotten / Clone / Map) historically ran a LIVE Snowflake
query on a cache miss. With Okta ``externalbrowser`` SSO that could pop an
interactive login on a plain tab open / poll — the exact footgun the Country and
Region tabs already avoid. This module gives the city tabs the same discipline:

  * their data endpoints read ONLY the on-disk plain cache
    (``snowflake_client.read_plain_cached``) and NEVER query, so a cold tab shows
    cached-or-empty data and can never spawn the SSO popup;
  * a lightweight per-tab ``/freshness`` endpoint reports whether the current
    view's cache is behind and — only when a Snowflake session is ALREADY live —
    kicks off a background warm of ONLY that view (the current city + the params
    actually being viewed), reusing ``auto_refresh`` (live-gate + per-scope dedup
    + cooldown + in-memory cache eviction on completion).

The frontend polls ``/freshness`` and re-fetches the (now-fresh) data endpoints,
mirroring the Region/Country poll loop. The warm work itself is plain
``execute_query(..., force_refresh=True)`` — the same file the matching data
endpoint reads — so there is no cache-key drift between what is warmed and what
is served.

    ``reads`` are the plain-cache queries the current view is composed of. The
    ``signal_index`` read is the DATED one whose newest cached date + file age
    drive the stale/fresh decision (dateless aggregates can't be date-compared, so
    they lean on file age only). A view is considered behind when its signal file
    is missing / older than ``ttl_seconds`` (default the 24h
    ``country_cache_ttl_seconds``, matching the deep-cache discipline — the SQL
    excludes today so data only changes daily) OR any read's file is absent.

    A warm is started ONLY when a Snowflake connection is already live
    (``auto_refresh.trigger``'s gate); otherwise the block reports
    ``reason="sso_required"`` so the UI shows the "Sign in to Snowflake" prompt
    instead of spinning. ``warm`` overrides the default action (which
    ``force_refresh``-es every read) — used by the Clone tab to reuse the admin
    ``_warm_clone_cache`` closure so the warmed set never drifts from it. The
    default warm reports one PROGRESS step per read (``total`` = ``len(reads)``);
    an override ``warm`` reports its own steps and passes its step count via
    ``warm_total``. ``force=True`` (an explicit user "Retry") bypasses the warm
    cooldown (still live-gated — never opens SSO).
