"""Offline unit tests for the canonical (month-anchored) deep-cache window.

Verifies ``app.config.canonical_max_lookback_days`` for several fixed "today"
values WITHOUT touching Snowflake/SSO (config import is offline and ``today`` is
injected). Run from the backend dir:

    ./venv/bin/python tests/test_canonical_window.py

It also works under pytest (``pytest tests/test_canonical_window.py``) if that
is installed, but needs no third-party deps to run as a plain script.
